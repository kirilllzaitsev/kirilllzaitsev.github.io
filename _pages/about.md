I am a Software Engineer and Computer Science MSc student, focusing on computer vision and deep learning for 3D scene understanding in robotics.
<br>
In industry, I have designed and implemented a wide range of machine learning and data processing solutions, working as an ML Engineer, Data Engineer, and Solutions Architect. My experience spans terabyte-scale ML pipelines, latency-critical and offline data workflows, IoT systems, and both cloud-based and on-premises data infrastructures. I enjoy working at the intersection of research and engineering, exploring ideas and turning them into reliable solutions.
